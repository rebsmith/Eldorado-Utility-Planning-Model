This repository contains all files necessary to run the Eldorado Utility Planning Model (EUPM) with multiple input scenarios and multiple sets of output data/formats. Once you download the directory, you can place it anywhere on your machine, set an environment variable named "ELDO" to the location of the unzipped directory, and the model will run. The documentation is in a Word document in the outer directory.

For more info about the philisophy of creating this model, see [cite model article]
